I have 1 html file for my java script file where I implement MergeSort
I have 1 JavaScript cheatSheet named accordingly I made mostly while watching a crash course 
I have 1 python main file where I implement MergeSort
I have 1 python cheatSheet named accordingly which i copied from a youtube video. I had to copy it in the end since It wasnt possible to run the code made without deleting previous code. I wrote all the code by hand but technically had to delete most of it.
I have 1 pseudoCode file for mergeSort which i used for both mini projects.
